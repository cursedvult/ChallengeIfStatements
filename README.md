# Challenge - If Statements

Create a user Login System, where the user can first register and then Login in.
The Program should check if the user has entered the correct username and password, when logging in (so the same ones that he used when registering).
As we haven't covered storing data yet, just create the program in a way, that registering and logging in, happens in the same execution of it.
Use If statements, User Input and Methods to solve the challenge.
